1. Feature implemented allowing computer to make the first move if selected
	a. After selecting "Play versus computer", player is prompted with
	   2 buttons: 1 for allowing the computer to go first and the other
	   for going second.
	b. If computer is selected to go first, first move is issued during
	   the new game event. This eliminates having to repeat lines of
           code in the selection event and function as it had before with
	   processing a player move and then a computer move (if applicable).
2. Comments added

1. UI Cleaned up 
	a. Button layouts changed
	b. Button text more readable
2. Bug fixed in determining game winner
	a. Originally, if neither player had majority wins in the series (i.e. in a best of 3 neither has 2) and the series 
	   extends to 3 games before either player wins, the series would be declared a TIE. This was fixed by adding a check 
	   so that if the series does extend to the max amount of games, determine which player has more wins.
3. Limited the # of games a player could manually input to the range 1-9

1. Smart AI Added
	a. AI first checks if it is in a position to win (i.e. within a row/column/diagonal, the computer has 2 of 
	its pieces and the 3rd spot is blank.) If so, its next move will be a winning one. Otherwise, the AI similarly 
	checks if it is in a losing position (same concept except it's 2 of the user's pieces in a row) and will attempt to
	block the user from winning. Otherwise, the AI will put a random piece down.
2. Fixed a bug where if the user chooses the AI to go first, the AI will only go first for the first game of the series and then 
second for the remaining games
