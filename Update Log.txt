1. Feature implemented allowing computer to make the first move if selected
	a. After selecting "Play versus computer", player is prompted with
	   2 buttons: 1 for allowing the computer to go first and the other
	   for going second.
	b. If computer is selected to go first, first move is issued during
	   the new game event. This eliminates having to repeat lines of
           code in the selection event and function as it had before with
	   processing a player move and then a computer move (if applicable).
